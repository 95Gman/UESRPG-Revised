{"name":"Cast Enchantment","content":"<p><strong>The Basics</strong></p>\n<p>Cast enchantments are spells “stored” within an item. A character wielding such an item can invoke this magic through the use of the Cast Magic Primary action, which allows them to cast the stored spell exactly as if they had cast it themselves (but with no casting test). The spell stored in the item can be either conventional or unconventional. Instead of being paid from the user’s magicka pool the cost of the spell is drawn from the item’s soul energy pool. Upkeep spells can be maintained by paying 2 * the spell’s level from the soul energy pool.</p>\n<p>The user counts as having passed the casting test with a number of degrees of success equal to the binding strength of the enchantment. A cast enchantment’s Binding Strength represents how well the enchantment was woven: stronger enchantments are more responsive to their users, and enable them to more easily shape the spell to their will.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Soul Energy Pool &amp; Recharging</strong></p>\n<p>Cast enchantments do not last forever! Each cast with the item reduces the item’s Soul Energy Pool by 1. If this would reduce the size of the pool to below zero, then the enchantment can no longer be cast and must be recharged.</p>\n<p>Recharging an item requires that the character be trained in the Enchant skill (though no test is required), and that they have a soul gem with energy stored within it. A simple minute long ritual is required: on completion the ES * 2 of the soul gem is added to the pool. Any energy that would exceed the pool’s maximum size is lost and the gem is destroyed.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Multi Spell Enchantments</strong></p>\n<p>Characters can create cast enchantments that have more than one spell stored (to a maximum of 3) but these enchantments are more difficult to create, and characters require a talent to attempt it. When used these function like normal cast enchantments, but the user simply chooses which spell to cast and reduces the amount of spells stored in the item from the it’s soul energy pool.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Learning Effects &amp; Forms</strong></p>\n<p>A character does not need to know a particular spell in order to imbue an item with it. Enchanters can also use any combination of effects and forms availible during the spell making process, and they do not need to be trained in a particular school to use effects from that school. Note that using a spell with a level above the character’s Enchant skill rank may be more difficult!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Reference Materials</strong></p>\n<p>A list of effects and forms can be found in the Appendix. Follow these steps to imbue items with cast enchantments:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Step 1: Choose Item</strong></p>\n<p>First the enchanter must pick an item to enchant. Cast enchantments can be applied to any item, but only some items will have an enchantment level high enough to reasonably support more powerful enchantments. Items without a listed Enchantment Level have an EL of 0.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 2: Choose Soul Gem</strong></p>\n<p>Next the enchanter must pick the soul gem they will use for the enchantment. This gem must have a ES less than or equal to the EL of the item. Once a soul gem has been used to create an enchantment it is destroyed and any excess energy is lost.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 3: Choose Enchantment Spell(s)</strong></p>\n<p>Cast enchantments can be used to store either conventional or unconventional spells. In the case of conventional spells, simply pick from the list in this chapter. Unconventional spells will need to be built using the effects and forms provided in the appendix as normal (though the enchanter does not actually need to spend the time or money to create the spell, and no test is needed).</p>\n<p>Once the enchanter has chosen the spell they will use for the cast enchantment, note its spell level for the next step. The Spell level used for the enchantment must be less than or equal to the ES of the soul gem used. If the enchanter is imbuing multiple spells into the cast enchantment, note the details for each one.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 4: Create the Enchantment</strong></p>\n<p>Now the enchanter can attempt to create the enchantment. This requires a ritual that lasts approximately eight hours, and consumes materials worth approximately 100 drakes. The enchanter then makes an enchant skill test with a -10 penalty for each level by which the chosen spell level exceeds their enchant skill rank (if applicable). Test again for any additional spells being added, if necessary. Failing a test means that spell is not successfully enchanted.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 5: Finalize Enchantment</strong></p>\n<p>Regardless of the outcome of the tests, the soul gem is destroyed and its energy is lost. If the enchanter passes a test then they successfully create the enchanted item. Write down the following details somewhere you can reference them:</p>\n<p>• Spells: Add the details of any spells included in the cast enchantment, including their spell level and effects.</p>\n<p>• Binding Strength: The binding strength (min 1) of the enchantment is equal to the DoS achieved on the enchant skill test.</p>\n<p>• Soul Energy Pool Max: The item’s soul energy pool max is equal to the Enchanter’s enchant skill rank * 2 .</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"eeXhsDlbzUBZOXZT":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_h4s9iq5zk1","path":"References#/CF_SEP/Arcane Items#/CF_SEP/Enchantment Categories","color":"#000000"}},"_id":"1wBdEK0Ef3immXJ0"}

{"name":"Potions","content":"<p><strong>The Basics</strong></p>\n<p>Unlike spells, potions do not have forms. Creating a potion is simply a matter of choosing the desired effects, setting the parameters of that effect to determine a final cost, and then writing down the effects of the potion for reference.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Multi Effect Potions</strong></p>\n<p>Characters can create potions that impart multiple effects when consumed. Creating these sorts of potions can prove more difficult for the character, but is not much more complicated than creating a normal potion.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Learning Effects</strong></p>\n<p>A character can use any effect from any school when creating potions, but attempting to use effects of a higher level than the character’s rank in the Alchemy skill can be difficult.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Reference Materials</strong></p>\n<p>A complete list of effects can be found in the Appendix.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Step 1: Choose Ingredients</strong></p>\n<p>First, decide on which ingredients you will use for the potion. Each ingredient included allows for a single effect to be added to the potion, and no more than three ingredients (and thus three effects, which must be unique) can be used in a single potion.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Step 2: Pick Effects &amp; Determine Parameters</strong></p>\n<p>Next, pick the effect(s) (maximum 3) that the potion will produce, and decide on their parameters. Only effects with the potion attribute may be used.</p>\n<p>The school(s) from which effects are chosen are limited to the school and number of ingredients used in the potion (for example, one destruction and one alteration ingredient would allow for one destruction and one alteration effect).Each effect has an associated value, called spell level, that determines its strength. The chosen spell level may not be higher than the depth of the chosen ingredient.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Step 3: Determine Spell Cost</strong></p>\n<p>Next, simply “plug in” your chosen spell level values to the effect cost formula provided for your chosen effect(s). If the cost of an effect is higher than the strength of the corresponding ingredient, then you must reduce the spell level of that effect.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Step 4: Create Potion</strong></p>\n<p>To create a potion a character must pass an Alchemy skill test. This test suffers a -10 penalty for each level by which the potion’s highest spell level effect exceeds the Alchemy skill rank of the character, and an additional -10 for potions with more than one effect. Creating a potion takes a number of hours equal to the total of the spell levels of its effects, and requires a set of alchemical tools. Ingredients are lost on failure.</p>\n<p>If a character critically fails this test, or fails normally when creating a potion that either includes multiple effects or an effect with a level above their Alchemy skill rank, the potion backfires. Roll a d4 on the creation backfire table and add the highest spell level included in the potion to the result.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Step 5: Finalize Potion</strong></p>\n<p>Write down the details of the new potion’s effects somewhere you can reference it, and then add it to your character’s gear list!</p>\n<p>Duration: If you choose an effect with the upkeep attribute, then the base duration of that effect is multiplied by an amount equal to the strength of the effect’s ingredient divided by the cost of the effect (rounded down to the nearest whole number).</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"eeXhsDlbzUBZOXZT":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_vqvknh6et3l","path":"References#/CF_SEP/Arcane Items","color":"#000000"}},"_id":"7SzULcLexomqDOEy"}

{"name":"Crafting & Reforging","content":"<p><strong>Step 1: Determine Item and modifications</strong></p>\n<p>First, the character must choose the item they wish to create. Some items cannot be created, such as those that only occur naturally, so the GM should use discretion when determining if a character can craft an item. The character must also choose the quality of the item, if applicable, which when combined with the item’s base price will allow them to determine the approximate market value of the item.</p>\n<p>When an item has been chosen, pick one or more modifications from the Weapon, Armor or Shield table below, which specifies the effect and difficulty of each. The number of upgrades that can be applied to the item (every level of scaled upgrades counts toward this level) is equal to half the characters Profession Smith rank rounded up (1 for rank 1, 3 for rank 5).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Step 2: Gather Raw Materials and modification materials</strong></p>\n<p>Next the character must gather the raw materials necessary to create the item. Exactly what this entails will vary from item to item, but as a general rule of thumb if the character wishes to purchase all the raw materials it will cost roughly one third of the item’s price as calculated in the last step.</p>\n<p>The character must also gather the necessary materials for the modifications, following the same guidelines as above. The general rule of thumb is that if the character wishes to purchase all the raw materials for the upgrades, it will cost roughly one fifth of the item’s base price as calculated in the last step for each modification (including levels) applied.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Step 3: Determine and modify Test Difficulty</strong></p>\n<p>Third the character determines the difficulty of the crafting test. The difficulty of the crafting test for most items is based solely on the quality of the item, and modified further as the GM sees fit. When creating weapons or armor the material also provides amodifier. See the tables below for test difficulties.</p>\n<p>After determining the initial test difficulty, add the relevant modifiers from any applied modifications to determine the final test difficulty that will be used in Step 4.</p>\n<table style=\"width:37.7868%\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:44.5438%\"><strong>        Quality</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width:54.7459%\"><strong>           Difficulty</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:44.5438%\">Inferior</td>\n<td style=\"width:54.7459%\">+30</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:44.5438%\">Common</td>\n<td style=\"width:54.7459%\">+0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:44.5438%\">Superior</td>\n<td style=\"width:54.7459%\">-30</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p> </p>\n<table style=\"width:99.1477%\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:20.5969%\"><strong>Material</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width:27.9142%\"><strong>Difficulty</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width:16.498%\"><strong>Material</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width:33.9881%\">\n<p><strong>Difficulty</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:20.5969%\">Adamantium</td>\n<td style=\"width:27.9142%\">-20</td>\n<td style=\"width:16.498%\">Leather</td>\n<td style=\"width:33.9881%\">+10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:20.5969%\">Bonemold</td>\n<td style=\"width:27.9142%\">-5</td>\n<td style=\"width:16.498%\">Malachite</td>\n<td style=\"width:33.9881%\">-20</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:20.5969%\">Bone</td>\n<td style=\"width:27.9142%\">+0</td>\n<td style=\"width:16.498%\">Mithril</td>\n<td style=\"width:33.9881%\">-10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:20.5969%\">Chitin</td>\n<td style=\"width:27.9142%\">+0</td>\n<td style=\"width:16.498%\">Moonstone</td>\n<td style=\"width:33.9881%\">-10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:20.5969%\">Dragonbone</td>\n<td style=\"width:27.9142%\">-40</td>\n<td style=\"width:16.498%\">Orichalcum</td>\n<td style=\"width:33.9881%\">-10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:20.5969%\">Dreugh Hide</td>\n<td style=\"width:27.9142%\">-10</td>\n<td style=\"width:16.498%\">Padded</td>\n<td style=\"width:33.9881%\">+30</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:20.5969%\">Dwemer</td>\n<td style=\"width:27.9142%\">-10</td>\n<td style=\"width:16.498%\">Silver</td>\n<td style=\"width:33.9881%\">-5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:20.5969%\">Ebony</td>\n<td style=\"width:27.9142%\">-30</td>\n<td style=\"width:16.498%\">Stahlrim</td>\n<td style=\"width:33.9881%\">-10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:20.5969%\">Fur</td>\n<td style=\"width:27.9142%\">+10</td>\n<td style=\"width:16.498%\">Steel</td>\n<td style=\"width:33.9881%\">+0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:20.5969%\">Iron</td>\n<td style=\"width:27.9142%\">+20</td>\n<td style=\"width:16.498%\">Wood</td>\n<td style=\"width:33.9881%\">+20</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Step 4: Make Crafting Test</strong></p>\n<p>Next the character makes the actual crafting test using the difficulty determined in the previous step. The skill that the character tests is based on the item they wish to craft. Creating weapons or armor uses the Profession [Smithing] skill, while other items will usually use some other variation of the Profession [Field] skill as appropriate. Failure produces no item, while critical success halves the time required.</p>\n<p>Creating any item requires the appropriate craft tools. In the case of smithing, the character will also need access to a forge (along with the related facilities and tools) in order to complete the product. The actual act of crafting can take anywhere from a few hours to a few days (and sometimes even longer). During this time the character must be focused on creating the item. The duration required is left to the GM, and should be based on the complexity of the item in question.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Runed Weapons/Armor</strong></p>\n<p>Characters with knowledge of Enchanting can imbue weapons and armor with magic runes that make them effective against certain types of enemies. The character must pass an Enchant test when creating the item (there is no penalty for failure). On success add the Magic weapon/armor quality.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Reforging</strong></p>\n<p>A smith can chose to reuse any existing weapon or armor when creating something new, regardless of how damaged it has become.</p>\n<p>To do so, find the price for an unmodified item of its type and mark down 1/3rd of its price (100 drakes for a Full Chest plate of steel worth 300 for example). You now have materials worth that much that can be spend on creating any item made from the same material, and multiple items can be broken down to provide enough materials for the crafting roll. Daedric items cannot be reforged this way, and will simply turn to dust if attempted.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Smithing Services</strong></p>\n<p>Custom crafted arms and armor can be extremely versatile, and extremely expensive. Characters can hire smiths to create items with upgrades of all types. Their cost is determined by the following formula:</p>\n<p><strong>Customized Item Price: Item + Upgrades + Fee</strong></p>\n<p>The cost for Upgrades is determined by the combined number of upgrades / upgrade levels wished for, 1 increases the cost of the base item by 20%, 2 by 50% and 3 by 100%.</p>\n<p>Lastly, the table below provides a guideline for the flat fee charged by the smith based on the final difficulty modifier of the chosen upgrades combined.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"eeXhsDlbzUBZOXZT":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_mszr8m82wq8","path":"References#/CF_SEP/Pricing & Acquisition","color":"#000000"}},"_id":"VqFLZn0M8UfhsaP5"}

Using a spell with a level higher than the character’s enchant skill rank can be difficult. Follow these steps to create a spell scroll:</p>\n<p><strong>Step 1: Gather Materials</strong></p>\n<p>Creating a spell scroll consumes materials worth approximately 25 drakes, and an hour long ritual.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 2: Create Spell Scroll</strong></p>\n<p>The character picks one of the spells they know and makes an enchant skill test penalized by -10 for each level by which the spell level exceeds their enchant skill rank. They must pay the cost of the spell as if they had cast it, either from their own magicka pool or by subtracting the cost from the soul energy of a soul gem in their possession (this does not destroy the gem). The character must choose if they wish to overload the spell (use their Willpower bonus for the scroll’s effect) or extend the duration via upkeep, if applicable, and must pay the appropriate associated costs.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 3: Finalize Scroll</strong></p>\n<p>On success, the character creates the spell scroll. The binding strength (min 1) of the scroll is equal to the character’s enchant skill rank.

{"_id":"gZfIStguLN2kk6m7","name":"Learning & Using Thu'um","content":"<p><strong>Learning Words of Power</strong></p>\n<p>Characters with the Thu’um skill trained may unlock the ability to use a given word of power with XP/CrP assuming that they have somehow learned the word of power during their adventures (meaning that the GM has control over which words the character may access at any given time).</p>\n<p>This represents the time spent to come to understand the nature of the word, and the practice required to be able to utilize it in a Shout. Learning a given word of power and the way it fits into a specific Shout without aid of some kind costs 200 XP/CrP per level of the Word (for example, the first word in a Shout would be 200 XP, the second 400 XP, etc.). Characters who have access to a guide (a teacher, an ancient text, or some other aid) during this process halve the cost.</p>\n<p><strong>Using the Thu’um</strong></p>\n<p>Using the Thu’um requires two things: the character must be trained in the Thu’um skill, and have knowledge of a Word of Power. Words of power make up Shouts, which are similar to spells.</p>\n<p>Characters may use Shouts with the Cast Magic Primary action. It is important to note, however, that using a Shout as a Cast Magic action does not provoke an Attack of Opportunity. There is simply no time to react to the Shout in a way that could stop its effects.</p>\n<p>Additionally, there’s more to using the Thu’um than just saying a few words: Shouting requires concentration and power. Each Shout has three words, and while speaking the first word is sufficient to produce an effect, each additional word adds more power to the Shout (but also requires more skill and energy to use).</p>\n<p>A given Shout may not be used in two consecutive rounds. Once a character uses a Shout, they may not use that Shout again for a number of rounds equal to the number of words used in the Shout.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 1: Choose Shout and Target</strong></p>\n<p>First, the character must declare the shout being used (specifically the number of words), and the target of the shout (if applicable). A character may only use a shout if they know the first word of that shout, and they may only use further words if they know those as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 2: Make Thu’um Test</strong></p>\n<p>Next, the caster makes a Thu’um skill test, the difficulty of which is determined by the shout the character has chosen. If the character passes the test, they successfully manifest the shout. If they fail, nothing happens. Either way, proceed to step 3. A critical success means no stamina is spent for the attempt so you may skip step 3 in this case.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 3: Spend Stamina</strong></p>\n<p>Attempting a shout takes a lot of energy, and the character is left drained afterwards. Characters who attempt a shout must spend one Stamina Point for each word used in the shout beyond the first. If a character fails a Shout, regardless of the number of words in the Shout, they lose one Stamina Point.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 4: Apply Effects</strong></p>\n<p>If the Thu’um test was successful, apply the effects of the shout to the target as specified in the shout profile, and based on the number of words the character used.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"eeXhsDlbzUBZOXZT":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_fkm4zwbf03p","color":"#000000"}}}

Shields do not benefit from this effect. <strong>Encumbrance Levels</strong></p>\n<p>The number of times that a character’s total ENC (the sum of the ENC of all the equipment they are carrying) exceeds their Carry Rating determines their Encumbrance Level. Higher encumbrance levels apply specific penalties:</p>\n<p>• Test Penalty: A penalty to all physical and movement based skill and characteristic tests.</p>\n<p>• Speed Penalty: A reduction of the character’s base Speed.</p>\n<p>• Stamina Penalty: A reduction of the character’s SP max. For each level this would reduce it below 0 the character gains a level of fatigue. These penalties represent the raw difficulty of carrying something too heavy for your character.

{"name":"Constant Enchantments","content":"<p><strong>The Basics</strong></p>\n<p>Constant enchantments are passive enchantments that can be applied to any sort of item, and that constantly affect the wearer or wielder of that item. In game terms, constant enchantments apply their effects to the character wearing/wielding them at the start of each round (regardless of their normal duration). If the effect is dispelled, it returns to full functionality after 1d4 rounds. Constant enchantments do not need to be recharged like cast enchantments and have no soul energy pool. The wearer or wielder of a constant enchantment can willingly disable or re-enable its effects at any time using the Cast Magic secondary action.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Learning Effects &amp; Forms</strong></p>\n<p>A character may attempt to create a constant enchantment using any effect from any school as long as that effect has the Upkeep Attribute, and a listed duration. It is not dependent on their knowledge of any spells.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Multi Effect Enchantments</strong></p>\n<p>Characters can create constant enchantments that have more than one effect (to a maximum of 3) but these enchantments are more difficult to create, and characters require a talent to attempt it.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Reference Materials</strong></p>\n<p>The complete list of effects can be found on the page below.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 1: Choose Item</strong></p>\n<p>First the enchanter must pick an item to enchant. Constant enchantments can be applied to any item, but only some items will have an enchantment level high enough to reasonably support more powerful enchantments. Items without a listed enchantment level have an EL of 0.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 2: Choose Soul Gem</strong></p>\n<p>Next the enchanter must pick the soul gem they will use for the enchantment. This gem must have an ES equal to or greater than the EL of the item. Once a soul gem has been used to create an enchantment it is destroyed and any excess energy is lost.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 3: Choose Constant Effect(s)</strong></p>\n<p>Constant enchantments are not created using the normal spell making rules. Instead, the enchanter simply picks the effect(s) they want and compares the combined enchantment strength(s) of their chosen effects to the table on the page below.</p>\n<p>Every effect has an EL min, this is the minimum enchantment level an item must have in order to use that effect. The enchantment strength chosen for the effect must be less than or equal to the enchantment strength of the soul gem used. Add the enchantment strength of any enchantments used when calculating multiple enchantments.</p>\n<p>If the soul gem has enough enchantment strength to power the enchantment, then they can attempt to create it, otherwise it is impossible as the enchantment cannot sustain itself on so little energy.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 4: Create the Enchantment</strong></p>\n<p>Now the enchanter can attempt to create the enchantment. This requires a ritual that lasts approximately eight hours, and consumes materials worth approximately 100 drakes. The enchanter then makes an enchant skill test with a -10 penalty for each level by which the total enchantment strength of the chosen effect(s) exceeds their enchant skill rank (if applicable).</p>\n<p><strong>Step 5: Finalize Enchantment</strong></p>\n<p>Regardless of the outcome of the tests, the soul gem is destroyed and its energy is lost. If the enchanter passes a test then they successfully create the enchanted item. Be sure to write down the effect(s) of the enchantment for reference.</p>\n<table style=\"width:99.1477%\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:19.0201%\"><strong>Name</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width:72.1389%\"><strong>Effect (ES = Enchantment Strength)</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width:7.98149%\"><strong>EL min</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:19.0201%\">Elemental Armour</td>\n<td style=\"width:72.1389%\">Affected target gains ES AR of the chosen [type]</td>\n<td style=\"width:7.98149%\">1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:19.0201%\">Magic Armour</td>\n<td style=\"width:72.1389%\">Affected target gains (ES-3) magic AR</td>\n<td style=\"width:7.98149%\">4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:19.0201%\">Armour</td>\n<td style=\"width:72.1389%\">Affected target gains (ES-1) AR</td>\n<td style=\"width:7.98149%\">2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:19.0201%\">Feather</td>\n<td style=\"width:72.1389%\">Affected target lowers its encumbrance level by one, and treats its armour as being one weight class lighter.
